# FindingImmo

This is my very own solution for finding my future house, by scraping real estate agencies' websites, prefiltering their ads and then submitting them to me through a website.

[Work In Progress]

## Architecture

The project is structured as a standard 3-tiers app.

## Coding guidelines

To check for code sanity and enforce some behaviour and style, the project uses :
* The .NET-integrated analyzer (for "Managed Binary Analysis")
* The [C# Coding Guidelines](https://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com), customized to suppress some "extrem" rules
* [SonarQube](https://sonarcloud.io/), with the default configuration 
Those tools were mainly used here to being tryed tested, inside a pseudo-real world context.
